## The WARBL Configuration Tool

The *WARBL2 Configuration Tool* uses *MIDI* to customize the *WARBL2 Settings*. It is accessible two ways, both of which are graphically identical and produce the same results in a *Connected WARBL2*: 

* As a *Web Page* in any *Web MIDI-aware Web browser*, or
* Using the dedicated *WARBL iOS/iPadOS App*

There is no dedicated *WARBL Android App* at this time.

As it is a *Web App*, it works using a *Suitable Web Browser* in any modern *Operating System (OS)*, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, and Android.

### Using A Web Browser

The *Configuration Tool Web Page* is at [https://warbl.xyz/configure.html](https://warbl.xyz/configure.html)

Because the *Configuration Tool* uses the relatively new [Web MIDI Protocol](https://midi.org/about-web-midi), your Web browser must support [Web MIDI](https://learn.adafruit.com/web-ble-midi/web-midi).

These currently include:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) (v43+)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (v36+)
  * Earlier versions require installing the [Jazz Web MIDI Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/web-midi-api/))
* [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ) (v79+), and
* [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)

[Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) unfortunately does not yet support Web MIDI.

### Using WARBL iPhone/iPad App

On iOS devices you can use the free [WARBL app](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/warbl-configuration-tool/id1445377915?l), generously made by Michael Eskin of [Appcordions](https://appcordions.com/).
