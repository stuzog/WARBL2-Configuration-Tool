It is accessible two ways, both of which are graphically identical and produce the same results in a Connected WARBL2: As a Web Page in any Web MIDI-aware Web browser, or Using the dedicated WARBL iOS/iPadOS App There is no dedicated WARBL Android App at this time. As it is a Web App, it works using a Suitable Web Browser in any modern Operating System (OS), including Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, and Android. Using A Web Browser The Configuration Tool Web Page is at https://warbl.xyz/configure.html Because the Configuration Tool uses the relatively new Web MIDI Protocol, your Web browser must support Web MIDI. These currently include: Chrome (v43+) Firefox (v36+) Earlier versions require installing the Jazz Web MIDI Extension) Microsoft Edge (v79+), and Opera Safari unfortunately does not yet support Web MIDI. Hopefully, it will do so some time in the future. Using WARBL iPhone/iPad App On iOS devices you can use the free WARBL app, generously made by Michael Eskin of Appcordions.

Once it has connected, it should show your Firmware Version in the upper right corner, and it will tell you if there is a Firmware Update available (see section 10 of the User Manual for updating the firmware). NOTE: If the WARBL2 Firmware is not up to date, you will be able to use the Configuration Tool, but some Options may be Dissing or disabled (shown in Grey). Volume Icon The Configuration Tool can produce basic Sounds if you click the Volume Icon. This is meant for Testing Purposes Only and the Sound will not respond to Pitch-Bend Commands or Control Change (CC) Messages. On iOS Devices it’s also usually possible to have other MIDI Apps running at the same time as the Configuration Tool, which is preferable and will give you Higher-Quality Sound. MIDI Console Button Tapping this will show the 300 Most Recent MIDI Messages received, useful for Trouble Shooting. MIDI Note Display Will show the MIDI Note currently being played, as Note Name Note Number, also useful for Trouble Shooting. WARBL Firmware Version This will show the Firmware Version of a connected WARBL2. If a WARBL2 is not connected, it will show in Red: Unknown WARBL not detected "],["instrument-settings.html", "Instrument Settings Per-Instrument Settings Default Instrument Fingering Pattern Transpose Menu Configure Custom Fingering Note Channel Bend Range Transient Note Filter (mS)", " Instrument Settings Instrument Settings Tabs WARBL has three Instruments available for use at any time, accessible by three Instrument Tabs. Each Instrument consists of a Fingering Pattern and a set of associated Settings. You can select different Fingering Patterns for each Instrument, or you can select the same Fingering Pattern for more than one Instrument. For example, if you only want to use Tin Whistle Fingering, you can select that option for all three Instruments, but still have three different sets of Settings available at any time. You may want to have the Settings configured differently for each Instrument, or have different Register Control and/or Slide/Vibrato settings. Per-Instrument Settings Selecting the Tab for an Instrument allows you to change the Settings for that Instrument. Please note that WARBL responds immediately to changes to settings for each Instrument, but if you don’t save them, those changes will be lost when you power down WARBL. You can choose to apply changes to settings to the current Instrument (by clicking Save settings for current instrument), or You can choose to apply them to all three instruments (click Apply to all instruments). This can be useful if you want to make three Instruments that are the same except for minor differences (which can be changed after applying the Initial Settings to all three Instruments). You can also Restore all factory settings. Default Instrument You can set the Default Instrument that will be active when WARBL is plugged in. This prevents having to click a button to switch instruments if your current favourite Instrument is not Instrument 1. To set the Default Instrument, simply click the Tab for that Instrument and then click Set as Default. This change will be saved immediately. This button does not appear in the Default Instrument Tab Fingering Pattern The Fingering Pattern Dropdown Menu allows you to choose a Fingering Chart. Information about each chart is available on the Documentation web page. Note that there are four Custom Charts available at the bottom of the list (see Configure Custom Fingering below). Transpose Menu This allows you to change keys. With WARBL2, if this is set to 0 (default), the Selected Fingering Chart will produce the notes shown in the Documentation (PDF). You can Transpose up or down as much as 18 Semitones to play in different Keys. Most MIDI Apps also allow transposing the received MIDI Notes, and often it is simpler to do this in the MIDI App rather than in the Configuration Tool. NOTE: With the original WARBL, this Menu will default to an Offset Value, but will still play by default in the Key shown in the documentation. Configure Custom Fingering Configure Custom Instruments Panel Tapping this WARBL2 Button opens the Custom Fingering Configuration Panel, where you can create Custom Fingerings. Tapping the &lt;– Back Button will close this Panel. WARBL2 has the ability to store up to 4 completely customizable Fingering Charts. Each Chart contains 256 MIDI Notes for every possible combination of the 8 tone holes (the Bell Sensor is not used). You will be pasting a list of 256 MIDI notes and their Fingerings into the box on the left. A special Google Sheet is available that will help you create your Custom Fingering Chart. A Link for the Sheet can be found on the WARBL Documentation Page. Google Fingering Sheet You don’t have to use this sheet but it helps simplify the process of making a Custom Fingering Chart. You’ll need to save your own copy of the Google Sheet so you can edit it. More information about how to make a Custom Fingering Chartuse can be found in the WARBL User Manual (PDF) and in the WARBL2 Custom Fingering Charts Video on the Facebook WARBL Group. Once you have made your List of MIDI Note Numbers, paste the values into the box at the left. Next, select one of Four Custom Charts in the center Then select location: dropdown menu as the location for saving the Custom Fingering Chart. (If you have previously saved a Chart in this same location it will be overwritten). It will take several seconds to load the new chart onto the WARBL2. After you have done this, click the &lt;– Back button, then select your Custom Chart from the Fingering Pattern dropdown menu (and Save Changes if desired). Note Channel Allows you to select the MIDI Channel (1-16) used for Sending Notes From WARBL. This should typically be left set to 1. Bend Range Is the number of Semitones of Pitch Bend that the WARBL will allow. This should typically be set to the default value of 2. Transient Note Filter (mS) Filters out very brief Unwanted Notes by adding a small delay in Milliseconds to the Tone Hole Sensors. This can be particularly useful when using Note Annotation Software to transcribe your playing. Without this delay, Very Brief Notes that you might not necessarily hear will be transcribed. This can also be used to clean up the sound of your playing by removing Crossing Noises that occur while changing from one Fingering Pattern to another. Be aware, however, that because this Filter works by adding a delay; setting it too high will give a sluggish feel to your playing. Set it to 0 for the fastest possible Tone Hole Response. "],["finger-vibrato-and-slide.html", "Finger Vibrato and Slide Slide Vibrato Legato Slide/Vibrato Advanced Pitch Bend Settings Send Pitch Bend Immediately Before Note On Send Notes As Legato", " Finger Vibrato and Slide Finger Vibrato and Slide Panel WARBL mimics open-tone hole instruments by sensing the distance of your fingers from the holes and using this information to bend notes downward. It can detect your fingers a maximum of about 1 cm (~1/2”) from the holes. You can choose: Slide and vibrato Vibrato only No pitch bend, or. Legato slide/vibrato. Slide The way Slide works is that lowering the finger over the highest uncovered hole will gradually flatten the current note down to the next lower note on the scale, much like on a real instrument. This can also allow you to approximate “half-holing” accidentals. Because of the nature of note transitions in MIDI, sliding between notes can sometimes result in a slight “popping” sound when the new note is triggered. This is quite apparent with some sounds like whistles and less so with other sounds like reed instruments. Whether you choose to use slide may depend partly on the MIDI host and sounds that you’re using. The normal Slide feature is limited to a maximum of 2 semitones before a different MIDI note is triggered. Vibrato Lowering fingers over any open holes (other than the Slide hole, if you also have Slide turned on) will gradually flatten the note down to the selected maximum vibrato depth. The Pitch Bend contributed by each hole is cumulative, meaning that lowering fingers over multiple holes simultaneously will flatten the note more than lowering just one finger. This gives control over the amount of Vibrato, and can be used to simulate sliding even when Slide isn’t turned on. If a finger is covering a hole when a note is triggered and subsequently lifting that finger doesn’t cause a different note to be triggered, then that finger will be available to use for Vibrato. However, to enable that finger, you first must remove it completely, past where WARBL can first detect it. This is to prevent problems with closed fingering patterns. As an example of how this works, if you trigger a note, completely remove a finger (one that doesn’t change the current note), and then place it back down, the resulting pitch will be lower than the originally triggered note because vibrato has been enabled. This is usually intuitive, but it’s important to understand because in certain cases it might not be immediately apparent why the resulting pitch is lower than the original pitch. You can select at the bottom of the panel which holes you’d like to have available for Vibrato. If you normally only use a few fingers for vibrato, you may want to select only those holes, to prevent unwanted behavior. Custom Vibrato Custom Vibrato is a different Vibrato option only available for some Fingering Patterns (currently Tin Whistle, Uilleann Pipes, GHB, and Northumbrian Pipes). Tin Whistle and Uilleann Pipes The differences from normal Vibrato are as follows: Only the first and/or second fingers of the right hand are available for Vibrato, depending on the fingering pattern (you cannot select vibrato holes if this option is turned on). Vibrato is not cumulative, meaning that lowering more than one finger doesn’t increase the vibrato depth. If a vibrato hole is covered when a note is triggered, the note is immediately flattened (this is the major difference and may be more natural in certain circumstances). When playing a back D with Uilleann Fingering, uncovering a Vibrato Hole actually lowers the pitch instead of raising it, which is how real pipes behave. GHB and Northumbrian Pipes Custom Vibrato is designed for Closed Fingering systems. It sharpens the note when finger R2 or R3 is raised from a Closed Fingering position (as opposed to the Normal Vibrato, where lowering a finger from an open position flattens a note). NOTE: Custom Vibrato is not available when any Unsupported Fingering has been chosen. Legato Slide/Vibrato This is different from the normal Slide in that it allows you to slide seamlessly over a range of more than 2 semitones without triggering a new MIDI note. The sliding range is determined by the: * MIDI Bend Range (Semitones) setting at the top of the Configuration Tool, and the * Legato Slide Limit (Semitones) setting in the Advanced Pitch Bend Settings panel. For proper Slide and Vibrato results, the Pitch Bend Range in the MIDI app or host that you are using must be set to the same number of semitones as the MIDI Bend Range (Semitones) setting. Legato Slide/Vibrato also uses additional holes as Slide Holes. Rather than using only the highest uncovered hole, it uses any hole that would normally cause a new note to be triggered if it was covered. Advanced Pitch Bend Settings Advanced Pitch Bend Settings Panel The Advanced… Button opens the Advanced Pitch Bend Settings Box. These settings can be left unchanged, but allow more control over how WARBL sends Pitch Bend Messages. Finger-Sensing Distance This is the relative distance at which the tone holes sense your fingers for slide and vibrato. You can reduce this distance using the slider if you don’t want to have to remove your fingers as far from the holes to turn off the pitch bend. The downside is that you’ll have less precision in bending notes. Vibrato depth (cents) The slider determines the degree to which notes are bent when using finger vibrato. Legato Slide Limit (semitones) This setting determines the maximum range for sliding if you are using the #4. Legato slide/vibrato option (see above). Note that the MIDI Bend Range (Semitones) must also be set at least as high, and you must also always set the MIDI Pitch Bend Range in whatever MIDI App or MIDI Host you are using, to the same value as the MIDI Bend Range (Semitones) setting. Send Pitch Bend Immediately Before Note On Normally, WARBL sends a Pitch Bend Message after a new MIDI Note is turned on. Some users may instead wish to send Pitch Bend before the note is turned on by using the Send pitch bend immediately before Note On switch. This may cause Pitch Bend Audio Artifacts with some MIDI Apps but is the recommended setting for MIDI MPE. Send Notes As Legato The Send notes as Legato switch causes WARBL to wait to turn off each MIDI Note until after the next MIDI Note is sent. This is the recommended setting for most MIDI Apps as it allows them to interpret the MIDI Notes as legato, allowing them to flow together seamlessly. Repeat Section – Table of Contents "],["note-trigger-and-register-control.html", "Note Trigger and Register Control Single Register Overblow Thumb Register Bell Register Calibrate at startup Learn or Enter Pressure Invert Thumb/Bell Switch Bagless Mode Bag/Breath Advanced Register Control Settings Pressure Graph", " Note Trigger and Register Control Note Trigger and Register Control Panel You can play in a Single Register or choose from Several Options for Controlling the Register. Single Register Will allow you to use breath or bag pressure to start/stop notes, but will only allow access to one register. The pressure sensor can be used to mimic the way that whistles, flutes, and some bagpipes can be “overblown” to reach the second octave. Overblow Enables Overblow Thumb Register Allows you use that finger to control the Register, which will be familiar to players of many Woodwind Instruments. To play the Upper Register, simply uncover the thumb hole. Bell Register Uncovering the Bell Sensor (lifting it off your knee), will access the Second Register. Calibrate at startup The Pressure Sensor normally will be calibrated at Startup, meaning that the pressure when you plug in the device will be used as a Base Point for determining the Pressure Level at which sound will be triggered. This is desirable if you are using breath to control the instrument. If you are using a Bag with this setting, you will want to squeeze it when you plug WARBL in to set the Pressure at which you want Notes to Begin Playing. Learn or Enter Pressure Alternatively, you can select to use a different Startup Pressure. This is usually preferable if you are using a Bag instead of Breath, and you want to trigger notes at a higher pressure. Squeeze the bag at the pressure that you would like to use for initial triggering of sound and then click Learn, which will cause WARBL to use the current pressure (as with all settings, you can save this pressure by saving the settings for the current instrument). After clicking Learn, the Pressure Input Cell will flash Green and the Learned Pressure will be displayed. You can also enter the desired pressure manually if you prefer. Simply type in a pressure between 0.0 and 24.0 inH2O (Inches of Water) and hit Return or Enter. The Input Cell will momentarily turn Green to indicate that the pressure setting was sent to WARBL. Invert Thumb/Bell Switch Reverse the functionality for either of the previous two options. Covering the Left Thumb Hole or covering the Bell Sensor then will allow playing in the Second Register, depending on which option is selected. This will be more familiar to players of instruments with a Register Key. Note: You can also use the IMU Elevation Angl to control the Register. This is discussed in the Pressure and IMU Mapping section. Bagless Mode Turning on Bagless Mode will allow you to configure a WARBL2 Button to start/stop the Sound instead of using the Pressure Sensor. This will be similar to many electronic bagpipe chanters that don’t use pressure sensing. You can still select one of the options for controlling the register when using Bagless Mode. Note: if you choose the Bagless option you must also configure a Button to Play/Stop (Bagless Mode). Bag/Breath Selecting Bag will cause the Overblowing Settings for Bagpipe Bags to be used Selecting Breath will cause the settings for Breath (Mouthpiece) to be used. These settings are customizable using the Advanced Panel if desired. If you have an original WARBL with firmware version 2.0 or earlier, you will see a Vented switch instead of the bag/breath options. Advanced Register Control Settings Advanced Overblowing Settings Panel These settings control the way that the Register is changed by Overblowing. Each variable below has a setting for a Bag and one for Breath (Mouthpiece). Which settings are used depends on whether you currently have Bag or Breath selected in the main Note Trigger and Register Control Panel. Note The Currently Selected group of Settings are surrounded by a White Box. The Variables that are most likely to need adjustment are located near the top. Threshold Represents how much pressure is required to move from the First Register to the Second Register. Increasing this setting gives you more control over the Registers but also makes it require more Breath or Bag pressure to overblow. Multiplier Wind Instruments that respond to Overblowing typically require more pressure to move to the Second Register from Higher Notes in the scale than it does from Lower Notes in the scale. This setting controls how pronounced is this difference. Increasing this setting can give you better control over the Register, especially if using a Bag, but will also increase the pressure required to reach the Second Register, particularly from higher notes in the scale. Note: Setting both Threshold and Multiplier too high can make it impossible to reach the highest notes in the Second Register because the pressure sensor is saturated, i.e. it has reached the highest pressure it can detect. If you find that you cannot reach the highest notes in the second register, try slightly reducing one or both of these settings. Hysteresis Makes it slightly easier to stay in the Second Register than it is to initially reach that Register. In other words, the pressure threshold for moving up to the Second Register is slightly higher than the threshold for moving back down. This is how real Wind Instruments behave. Jump and Drop Times WARBL has the ability to Jump directly from silence to the Second Register or to Drop directly from the Second Register to Silence. * By Blowing Forcefully (particularly by Tonguing a Note), you can begin playing in the Second Register without first playing a brief Note in the First Register. * By Cutting Off Air Pressure Suddenly, you can drop directly from the Second Register to Silence. WARBL detects the player’s intent by waiting a small amount of time for a Register Threshold to be crossed, or for the Pressure to level off, to. * Increasing the Jump time setting makes it easier to move directly to the Second Register. * Increasing the Drop time has a similar effect for moving directly from the Second Register to Silence. Bag and Breath Defaults Buttons Clicking the Bag Defaults Button restores the Default Bag Settings for all Variables in the Panel Clicking the Breath Defaults Button restores the Default Settings for Breath. Units are not shown for some Settings because they use arbitrary units. Pressure Graph Pressure Graph Shows WARBL pressure sensor readings in inches of H2O over time. "],["pressure-and-imu-mapping.html", "Pressure and IMU Mapping Pressure Mapping IMU Mapping", " Pressure and IMU Mapping Pressure and IMU Mapping Panel Breath Pressure and IMU (Gyroscope and Accelerometer) data can be mapped to various MIDI Messages. Click on Pressure Mapping or IMU Mapping to see the options. Pressure Mapping Pressure Mapping Panel This was known as the Expression Panel in earlier versions of the Configuration Tool. It allows mapping of Breath (or Bagpipe Bag) Pressure to various MIDI Messages. Force Max Velocity Turning on the Force Max Velocity switch will cause WARBL to always send MIDI Notes with a Velocity of 127 (the maximum allowed), which will allow Maximum Volume from MIDI Apps. Note: Some more sophisticated Apps interpret High Velocity in ways that also affect their Timbre, or various other Effects. If this is the case, you may want to uncheck this Switch, which will cause WARBL to send notes with a Velocity of 64 (the middle of the allowed range). This switch has no effect if the Send Pressure as Velocity is selected. Selecting the Send Pressure as Velocity Switch automatically overrides and turns OFF the Force Max Velocity switch at the top of this panel. Pitch Expression Turning on the Pitch Expression switch will cause WARBL to send Pitch Bend Messages based on Pressure. This means that for a given MIDI Note, blowing (or squeezing a Bag) gently will cause the Note to play slightly Flat, while blowing with excess force will cause it to be slightly Sharp. This is meant to simulate the way that Pressure is used to Fine-Tune the Pitch of Real Instruments, and can make WARBL sound more lifelike. Pitch Expression Depth The Pitch Expression Depth slider controls the amount of Pitch Bend, which is added to any contributed by Vibrato and Slide, so they can all be used simultaneously. Override… If Overblowing is not being used, this gives you have the option of changing the Default Pressure Range used for Expression. Pitch Expression Pressure-Range Override Panel By turning on the Override Switch and using the Sliders, you can override the Default Pressure Range used for Pitch Expression. Note: This is not available if Overblowing is being used, because in that case the Pressure Range has to be calculated in Real Time based on the current Register and Overblowing settings. Send Pressure Mapping CC Mapping Panel. The other Mapping Panels are similar WARBL also has the ability to Map Pressure Sensor Values to * A MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) * Note-On Velocity * Channel Pressure, and * Key Pressure This allows it to function as a MIDI Breath Controller. An example would be to send Pressure data to CC7 to control the Notes Volumes with Pressure.These Advanced Settings are not needed by many WARBL users. The Input Pressure Range can be mapped to the Output Range (CC, Velocity, Channel Pressure, or Key Pressure) using one of three curves: Linear A Power Curve (Curve 2), or An Inverse Power Curve (Curve 3) Adjusting the Sliders controls which portion of the overall Breath/Bag Pressure is mapped to which portion of the possible MIDI Output Range of 0-127. When Mapping Pressure to CC you can choose a CC Channel and CC Number. NOTE: WARBLE2 will only be sending those Messages if the corresponding Switch in the main Pressure Mapping Panel is turned ON. The Received Value field and bar at the bottom show the MIDI Messages received from the WARBLE2 that correspond to the Current Panel. For example, if you are mapping Breath Pressure to CC 7 on Channel 1, the display will show only those specific messages. IMU Mapping IMU Mapping Panel The Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) continuously tracks Acceleration and Angular Rotation in Three Dimensions. This information is converted to Roll, Elevation Angle (Pitch), and Yaw, which can be then mapped to MIDI Messages. Pitchbend Vibrato There is also an option to send Pitchbend Vibrato by shaking the WARBLE2 along its Long Axis. You can adjust the amount of Shake Vibrato and also select the Direction of Pitchbend: Up/Down means that the Pitch will be altered both above and below the normal pitch, corresponding to the direction of movement of the WARBL2. Down/Up has the same effect but the opposite direction of the movement of the device. Up only causes Pitch to be only raised above the current note, and Down only causes the pitch to only be flattened Roll, Elevation, and Yaw Mapping Roll Mapping Panel To map Roll, Elevation, or Yaw to CC Messages, turn ON the appropriate Switch and then click Map. A Panel similar to the one above will appear, allowing you to select the Input Range as well as the Range of Output CC Values. At the bottom a Readout and Bar will display CC Messages Received from the WARBL2 that match the Current Settings in the Panel Note: The Switch on the Previous Panel must also be turned ON to cause the WARBL2 to actually send any Messages. For mapping Roll and Yaw, there is an option to center the Input Range, which Ties the Input Sliders Together to keep the Input Range centered on Zero. Note: It is impossible to Reverse the Output Range of the IMU Mapping in the WARBLE2 by moving the Output Sliders past each other. When they meet in the Middle of the Range they will Merge into one. Moving this to the Right or Left will show the two Yellow Range Limits. Recentering Yaw Yaw has a tendency to drift slightly over time, so you may want occasionally to Recenter it (i.e. set it to zero). It is also often desirable to Recenter the Yaw depending on the Rotation of your Body. There are three ways to recenter Yaw: * A button in the WARBLE2 Settings Panel will recenter it center * You can assign a button action to recenter it (see the Button Behavior panel documentation), or * You can use the auto-center yaw option in the yaw mapping panel. The auto-center yaw option will reset the yaw to zero when you begin playing after a pause of a certain length of time. You can choose the length of the pause with the Minimum pause slider. There is also an option to control the register using the IMU elevation angle. You can choose the total number of registers and the input elevation range. The normal playing range (based on the transpose setting) will be in the middle of the range and you will be able to play up to two registers above and below that range. If overblowing is also enabled you will be able to use both methods of register control simultaneously. "],["drones-control.html", "Drones Control No Drone Control Use Secret Button Turn On/Off With Chanter Use Pressure", " Drones Control Drones Control Panel WARBL makes it possible to control Drones in MIDI Bagpipe Host Apps by choosing from a few ways of sending Drones On and Drones Off commands. You can choose to send: * Note On * Note Off, or * CC Messages, And assign the: * Channel * Byte 2 and * Byte 3. For Note on and Note Off Messages * Byte 2 is a MIDI Note Number * Byte 3 is Velocity For CC Messages * Byte 2 is the CC Number * Byte 3 is the Value The Commands used for Turning Drones On and Off will depend on the MIDI Host App. For example, the Celtic Sounds app uses a Note On Command both for turning Drones both On and Off. In apps such as Universal Piper, you can choose which Command you’ll use to control the Drones. No Drone Control Select this to assign a Specific Button Action to control the Drones, and then assign a WARBL2 Button Action to Turn Drones On/Off in the Button Behavior panel below. Use Secret Button Allows you to turn the Drones On and Off by pressing WARBL2 Button 1 while covering the Right-Hand Index-Finger Hole. Turn On/Off With Chanter Will cause the Drones to be On whenever the Chanter is playing. This will be true no matter how you control the Chanter, so will work in Bagless Mode as well as using the Pressure Sensor. Use Pressure Will turn the Drones On and Off at a given Pressure Threshold, so, for example, you can mimic Real Bagpipes by having the drones come On at a Baseline Pressure and the Chanter come On at a Higher Pressure. Learn You can either Learn the pressure by tapping this button, or enter it manually as inH2O, as with the Note Trigger Pressure. "],["button-behavior.html", "Button Behavior Momentary None Send MIDI Message", " Button Behavior Button Behavior WARBL2 Buttons 1, 2, and 3 can be programmed to perform different actions. This is useful for sending special Commands to MIDI Apps, or customizing the ability to Switch Modes. Note: It can be confusing if you assign different Buttons Actions in the three different Instruments, so it may be useful to use the same Actions in all three. New to WARBL2 are 2 Additional Actions included with the Button Actions to trigger Commands: You can either “sip” the Mouthpiece, or Shake the Device. Because these are both relatively easy to do accidentally, it is recommended to only use these for Commands that won&#39;t have adverse effects or cause confusion if triggered accidentally, e.g. Re-Centering Yaw or MIDI Panic. If a WARBL2 Button Click is configured to send MIDI Note On/Note Off Messages, the Normal Behavior is to alternate between sending Note On and Note Off Messages each time the WARBL2 Button is Pressed. NOTE: The Action actually occurs when the Button is Released. Momentary There is also the option to choose Momentary behavior: the WARBL2 Button will send a Note on Message when pressed and a Note Off Message when released, useful if you only want a Note to be on when the WARBL2 Button is held Down, for example for mimicking Uilleann Pipe regulators. Note: If Momentary is Selected, other Actions using that same Button will be Disabled, because it&#39;s not possible to differentiate other intentions from a Momentary Press. None No action will result if a WARBL2 Button is pressed. Send MIDI Message Note On/Note Off If you are sending Note on/Note Off Messages: * byte 2 is the MIDI Note Number, and * byte 3 is Velocity CC Messages If you are sending CC Messages: * byte 2 is the CC Number, and * byte 3 is the Value Note: CC Messages 102-119 on Channel 7 are reserved for the Configuration Tool, so WARBL cannot be programmed to send additional Messages in this Range. Send PC Selecting this will send a Program Change Message to the selected Channel, useful e.g. to Select a Particular Instrument in a MIDI Host App. Increase PC and Decrease PC These assume a Program Change value of 1 when WARBL2 is started, then Increase or Decrease it from there, e.g. clicking a WARBL2 Button assigned to Increase PC after starting WARBL will send a PC Message of 2 on the selected Channel. These commands are useful for Consecutively Stepping Through Available Sounds in a MIDI App. Additional Momentary Switches Momentary Switches are available when you have selected: Octave Shift Up Octave Shift Down Semitone Shift Up, or Semitone Shift Down. This allows you to use a WARBL2 Button to momentarily shift the Octave or Key, extending the range of the Instrument and allowing any WARBL2 Button to act as a “key” for Sharpening or Flattening a Note. Auto Callibration A WARBL2 Button can be assigned to begin Auto Calibration. This can be useful if you anticipate needing to auto calibrate when you don’t have access to the Configuration Tool. However, you’ll want to use a WARBL2 Button combination that can’t be Triggered Accidentally, for example holding WARBL2 Button 2 and clicking either WARBL2 Button 1 or WARBL2 Button 3. Also, when you begin Auto Calibration with a Button Combination, you need to be careful not to cover any of the Sensors while pressing the WARBL2 Buttons, because if you are pressing firmly on the Sensors when Auto Calibration begins it will give WARBL incorrect examples of covered Sensors. Power Down By default, a long-press of WARBL2 Button 3 will power down the WARBL2. If you’d prefer not to use a button to power down, you can choose to let it power down automatically (see the WARBL2 Settings Panel). Recenter the Yaw Recenters the Yaw. Show Battery Level When triggered, will blink the LED Turquoise from 1-10 times according to the Battery Level Percentage. If the Battery Level is lower than 10%, the LED will blink Red once. “Secret” Button Commands There are a few additional Hard-Coded Actions that involve Covering Certain Tone Holes while clicking WARBL2 Button 1. These can be useful if Normal Button Actions are used for Other Functions, giving an alternative way of Changing Slide/Vibrato Mode and Instrument. With the Use “secret” button commands turned On * Covering only Tone Hole L3 while pressing WARBL2 Button 1 will change the Slide/Vibrato Mode, and * Covering only Tone Hole R3 while pressing WARBL2 Button 1 will change the Instrument. Note that the Use &quot;secret&quot; button commands switch does not have to be on to use the &quot;secret&quot; drone control button, if that option is selected in the Drones Control panel. "],["optical-sensor-calibration.html", "Optical Sensor Calibration Auto-Calibrate All Sensors Auto-Calibrate Bell Sensor Only Save Fine Calibration", " Optical Sensor Calibration Optical Sensor Calibration Panel The Optical Sensors may occasionally need to be Calibrated, for example * When the WARBL2 is new * If a new person is playing the device, or * The sensors are a bit dirty. Calibration can also be used in a pinch to compensate for having dirty hands, but it’s much easier to wash your hands… Auto-Calibrate All Sensors If the Calibration is Far Off or you want to Calibrate Quickly, you can run Auto-Calibration. Begin by holding the WARBL2 in a Well-Lit Room (but not Direct Sunlight) in such a way that no Tone Holes are covered. (Important because it gives the WARBL2 examples of Raw Sensor Readings) Then click Begin Auto-Calibration. The LED on WARBL will turn on and then you’ll have 10 Seconds to lightly place your fingers over All the Tone Holes. Pressing harder on each Tone Hole will make it more difficult to “cover” them after Auto-Calibration. After this the Calibration should be reasonably close. The Bell Sensor will only be Calibrated if it is currently Plugged In. If this is the case, Rest the Bell Sensor on whatever Surface you intend to use with it, while also covering the Tone Holes with your fingers. Note that auto-calibration is always saved immediately; it is not necessary to click Save fine calibration afterward. Auto-Calibrate Bell Sensor Only You also have the option of auto-calibrating only the bell sensor. This is useful because the sensor may respond differently depending on the type of clothing you’re wearing. To do this, hold WARBL up in the air so the sensor is completely uncovered, click Auto-calibrate bell sensor only, and then lower the sensor onto your knee. After five seconds, the LED with turn off and the sensor will be calibrated. Save Fine Calibration After Auto-Calibration or for more frequent adjustments, you can just Fine-Tune Each Sensor Individually. Clicking the Up Arrow will make it easier to “cover” the Tone Hole Clicking the Down Arrow will make it more difficult. Note that when you plug in WARBL, values for each sensor will always read zero, and any changes will be relative to the current calibration. Changes to individual sensors will take place immediately so you can test them as you are changing them. You must click Save fine calibration for the changes to be saved, otherwise the Calibration will be reset when the WARBL2 is unplugged. "],["warbl2-settings.html", "WARBL2 Settings Battery Voltage BLE status Send BLE/USB Charge From USB Hosts Auto Power Off Time Calibrate Gyro Recenter The Yaw", " WARBL2 Settings WARBL2 Settings Panel Contains information and settings specific to WARBL2. Changes are saved immediately; it is NOT necessary to Save Settings for the Current Instrument, and as with Sensor Calibration, they apply to the Entire Device rather than a Specific Instrument. Battery Voltage Is shown as a convenience, but the Battery Percentage Monitor on the far right is usually a more reliable indicator of Charge Level. Note: Battery Charge Level is an Estimate and becomes more accurate after letting the Battery run all the way down (until the WARBL2 powers OFF), then re-charging fully. When Charging, a Charging Icon is shown next to the Battery Percentage Monitor. If the Charging Icon is blinking, it may be: * An Indicator of a Battery Fault such as: * Very Low or Very High Temperatures, or * The Battery is Too Old to Charge BLE status Shown at the Bottom Left. When connected by BLE it will show the Connection Interval in Milliseconds. Send BLE/USB If the WARBL2 is connected to both BLE and USB, you can choose whether to send MIDI Data over Either or Both connections. If only One Connection is available, it will be used regardless of this setting. WARBL2 will also communicate with the Configuration Tool by All Available Connections regardless of this setting. Charge From USB Hosts WARBL2 can be charged from any USB Host * PC, Mac, Tablet, or ’phone, or * From a USB Charging Brick. Charging from a USB Host can be turned Off, recommended if you are using USB MIDI and the WARBL2 is often connected to a Host. This will help save the battery of your Host Device. Auto Power Off Time To save battery life, WARBL2 will Shut Down Automatically after some time if no MIDI Notes have been sent or commands have been received from the Configuration Tool. You can adjust the Power Off Time from 1 to 20 minutes. You can also Assign a Button Action to Power Off in the Button Behavior Panel. Calibrate Gyro The Gyroscope is calibrated when the WARBL2 is made, but you may wish to Calibrate It Again occasionally (especially if the Roll and Elevation seem to drift slightly when the WARBL2 is stationary). Set the WARBL2 on a Stationary Surface and click Calibrate Gyro. Recenter The Yaw If you are using IMU Yaw to send MIDI Data, you can Recenter the Yaw with this Button. You also can: * Assign a Button Action to Recenter the Yaw * In the Button Behavior Panel, and * Automatically Recenter the Yaw when there is a break in Notes * In the Yaw Mapping Panel "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
