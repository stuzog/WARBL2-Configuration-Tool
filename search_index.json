It is accessible two ways, both of which are graphically identical and produce the same results in a Connected WARBL2: As a Web Page in any Web MIDI-aware Web browser, or Using the dedicated WARBL iOS/iPadOS App There is no dedicated WARBL Android App at this time. As it is a Web App, it works using a Suitable Web Browser in any modern Operating System (OS), including Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, and Android. Using A Web Browser The Configuration Tool Web Page is at https://warbl.xyz/configure.html Because the Configuration Tool uses the relatively new Web MIDI Protocol, your Web browser must support Web MIDI. These currently include: Chrome (v43+) Firefox (v36+) Earlier versions require installing the Jazz Web MIDI Extension) Microsoft Edge (v79+), and Opera Safari unfortunately does not yet support Web MIDI. Hopefully, it will do so some time in the future. Using WARBL iPhone/iPad App On iOS devices you can use the free WARBL app, generously made by Michael Eskin of Appcordions.
