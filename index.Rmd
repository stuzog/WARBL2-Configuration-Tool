# Introduction

![WARBL Icon](images/WARBL_Icon.png)

The *Configuration Tool* is a web page that connects to the WARBL2 using MIDI protocol to let you customize its *Settings*. Because the *Configuration Tool* uses the relatively new [Web MIDI](https://midi.org/about-web-midi) protocol, It is necessary to use a browser that supports [Web MIDI](https://learn.adafruit.com/web-ble-midi/web-midi), which currently include:

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) (v43+)
* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (needs [Jazz Web MIDI Extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/web-midi-api/))
* [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?form=MA13FJ) (v79+), and
* [Opera](https://www.opera.com/)
* [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) unfortunately does not yet support Web MIDI.


on

* Windows
* Mac
* Linux
* Chromebook, or
* Android

On iOS devices you can use the free [WARBL app](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/warbl-configuration-tool/id1445377915?l), generously made by Michael Eskin of [Appcordions](https://appcordions.com/).
