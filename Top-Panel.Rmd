## Connect To WARBL
The *Configuration Tool* will try to connect to WARBL if it is already plugged in or connected by *BLE MIDI* when the page is loaded, or you can click **Connect to WARBL** if it hasn't connected automatically. 

Once it has connected, it should show your *Firmware Version* in the upper right corner, and it will tell you if there is a *Firmware Update* available (see section 10 of the User Manual for updating the firmware).

	NOTE: If the WARBL2 Firmware is not up to date, you will be able to use the Configuration Tool, but some Options may be Dissing or disabled (shown in Grey).

## Volume Icon
The *Configuration Tool* can produce basic *Sounds* if you click the *Volume Icon*. This is meant for *Testing Purposes Only* and the *Sound* will not respond to *Pitch-Bend Commands* or *Control Change (CC) Messages*. On *iOS Devices* it's also usually possible to have other *MIDI Apps* running at the same time as the *Configuration Tool*, which is preferable and will give you *Higher-Quality Sound*.

## MIDI Console Button 
Tapping this will show the 300 *Most Recent MIDI Messages* received, useful for *Trouble Shooting*.

## MIDI Note Display 
Will show the *MIDI Note* currently being played, as *Note Name  Note Number*, also useful for *Trouble Shooting*.

## WARBL Firmware Version
This will show the *Firmware Version* of a connected WARBL2.

If a WARBL2 is not connected, it will show in *Red*:
	Unknown  
	WARBL not detected
